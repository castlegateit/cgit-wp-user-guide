# Castlegate IT WP User Guide #

Castlegate IT WP User Guide adds a user guide to the WordPress admin panel. A basic user guide is included in the plugin. This can be overridden by including a file called `user-guide.php` in the (child) theme directory. This should only include the HTML content of the user guide.
