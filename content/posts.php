<p>By default, WordPress supports posts and pages. Posts are news or blog articles, displayed in date order on the front end of your website. They may also be accessed by date-, category-, or tag-based archives. Pages represent static content. Pages can be organized into a simple nested structure, so that one &ldquo;parent&rdquo; page can contain one or more &ldquo;child&rdquo; pages.</p>

<p>Clicking on Posts or Pages in the main menu will display of list of entries, with some basic information about each one. From here, clicking on individual post or page titles will open the edit screen. You can also click on &ldquo;Add New&rdquo; at the top of the list to write a new post or page, also using the edit screen.</p>
