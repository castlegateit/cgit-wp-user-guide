<h3>The Dashboard</h3>

<p>The main WordPress admin screen is the Dashboard. At the top of the screen is the admin bar, which contains quick links to the front end of the site and to your user profile. It also includes a &ldquo;New&rdquo; link, which provides a quick way of writing a new post or page. Depending on your WordPress theme and your user settings, the admin bar will also be displayed on the front end of the site while you are logged in.</p>

<p>On the left side of the Dashboard is the main menu, which will contain the following items by default:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Dashboard: the main WordPress admin screen</li>
    <li>Posts: date-based news or blog posts, with optional categories and tags</li>
    <li>Media: images and other files uploaded to the website</li>
    <li>Pages: static content pages</li>
    <li>Comments: comments submitted to posts and pages</li>
</ul>

<p>A customized WordPress theme may remove some of these entries and it may add others for other types of content more relevant to your site. When you click on these items, you will see a sub-menu. For example, the Posts menu can contain sub-menu items for Categories and Tags.</p>

<h3>Posts and Pages</h3>

<p>By default, WordPress supports posts and pages. Posts are news or blog articles, displayed in date order on the front end of your website. They may also be accessed by date-, category-, or tag-based archives. Pages represent static content. Pages can be organized into a simple nested structure, so that one &ldquo;parent&rdquo; page can contain one or more &ldquo;child&rdquo; pages.</p>

<p>Clicking on Posts or Pages in the main menu will display of list of entries, with some basic information about each one. From here, clicking on individual post or page titles will open the edit screen. You can also click on &ldquo;Add New&rdquo; at the top of the list to write a new post or page, also using the edit screen.</p>

<h3>Editing Content</h3>

<p>Adding new posts or pages, or editing existing ones, is done using the edit screen. At the top of the screen is a large text field for the post title. Below that is the permalink, the URL for the post. You should not change the permalink after a post has been published: you will break incoming links from other sites and search engines.</p>

<h4>Content Editor</h4>

<p>Below the title and permalink is the main content editor. This has a basic WYSIWYG interface that lets you mark text as bold or italic, enter bullet and numbered lists, and mark text as a heading. Please take care to use headings as headings, rather than using bold or other &ldquo;presentational&rdquo; formatting. Using the correct markup for a page makes your content more readable to Google and other search engines.</p>

<p>The button on the right of the content editor toolbar is labelled &ldquo;Toolbar Toggle&rdquo;. Use this to show more content formatting options. This also reveals a &ldquo;Paste as text&rdquo; button that allows you to paste formatted content from another application while stripping out any styles that would affect its appearance on your website. It is strongly recommended that you use this when pasting from a word processor, such as Microsoft Word.</p>

<p>Note that the content editor is not a word processor; it is a means of preparing HTML content for your website. The styles and formatting are controlled by a site-wide stylesheet and the content may be filtered before it is displayed on the front-end of the site. Do not attempt to use the content editor to style the content or to add white space to affect the layoutâ€”let the website do that for you!</p>

<h4>Categories and Tags</h4>

<p>Posts can be organized using categories and tags. These appear on the right side of the edit screen. Categories are required, so any posts that are not assigned to a category will be placed in the &ldquo;Uncategorized&rdquo; category. Tags are entirely optional.</p>

<h4>Page Attributes</h4>

<p>The &ldquo;Page Attributes&rdquo; box on the right side of the edit screen lets you organize your pages. A page can act as a &ldquo;parent&rdquo; page, containing one or more &ldquo;child&rdquo; pages. Use the &ldquo;Parent&rdquo; dropdown in the Page Attributes box to assign the current page to a parent.</p>

<p>The Page Attributes box also includes a field for &ldquo;Order&rdquo;, which lets you specify the menu order of the pages. Lower numbered pages will appear at the top of menus; higher numbered pages will appear lower. This will not have an effect if you are using a custom menu, or if your theme generates a menu using a non-standard method.</p>
